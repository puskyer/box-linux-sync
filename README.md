box-linux-sync - A naïve [Box.com](http://box.com/) Linux Client
================================================================

An unofficial attempt to create a Linux synchronization client because Box.com does not provide one.

NOTICE
------

If your Box sync stopped working please open your `/etc/fstab` file and update the WebDav URL from `https://www.box.com/dav` to `https://dav.box.com/dav`.

[Box.com blog post](https://support.box.com/entries/28641946-Features-to-be-removed-in-Q4-2013):

> On November 15, 2013, we will be transitioning from the current WebDav (https://www.box.com/dav) to a new version (https://dav.box.com/dav) that provides added stability and performance improvements. Please change the URL in any internal apps before November 15 to ensure your users can continue accessing content via WebDav. 

Overview
--------

File synchronization is currently done using the WebDAV interface provided by Box.com. There is also a [Python API](https://github.com/box/box-python-sdk) available but I haven't started to mess with it.

Requirements
------------

* [Python](http://www.python.org/download/releases/) 2.7 and up (may work on earlier versions, haven't tested).
* [Davfs2](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/davfs2). To install it use:
    * Debian, Ubuntu: `apt-get install davfs2`
    * Red Hat, SuSE, Fedora: `yum install davfs2`
    * Gentoo: `emerge davfs2`
    * ArchLinux: `pacman -S davfs2`

Installation
------------

    $ cd ~/path/of/your/choice
    $ git clone git://github.com/noiselabs/box-linux-sync.git

Installation via Pip is not currently available. Let's wait for a proper release, OK?.

Usage
-----

###### Check environment and setup `box-sync` and it's dependencies:

    $ cd ~/path/to/box-linux-sync/bin
    $ ./box-sync check && ./box-sync setup

###### Edit `~/.noiselabs/box/box-sync.cfg` to fit your preferences:

    $ vim ~/.noiselabs/box/box-sync.cfg

    ; box-sync.cfg
    [main]

    ; Path to your Box sync dir. Use a relative path to place this dir
    ; inside $HOME or an absolute path. Default: Box
    box_dir = Box

    ; Wether to use a WebDAV filesystem to synchronize your local and
    ; remote files. Default: true
    use_davfs = true

###### Start synchronization via Davfs:

    $ ./box-sync start

###### Stop synchronization:

    $ ./box-sync stop

###### Send `box-sync` into oblivion when you get tired of it.

###### To Use /sbin/mount.davfs as a non-root user run the following "sudo dpkg-reconfigure davfs2" and and answering 'yes' to the setuid question. ths is only required if you already had davfs2 installed or you did not read the instrusctions when installing it.

This just removes `box-sync` configuration files and the repository, not your personal Box.com files (unless you have configured the `box_sync` dir to be inside `~/.noiselabs`).

    $ ./box-sync uninstall
    $ rm ~/path/to/box-linux-sync
